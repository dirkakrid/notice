overview
--------

`notice` provides the command-line user of Unix-like systems with a simple
logging utility of thoughts and command output.

installation
------------

Put the enclosed `notice` script somewhere in your `$PATH`.

`notice` is a stand-alone script, with dependencies on:

 * GNU bash, though `sh` might work, too.
   (Just change `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`.)
 * `cat` command (likely /bin/cat)
 * `date` command (likely /bin/date)

These dependencies are given on any Unix-like system, as they are part of the
Unix standard.

configuration
-------------

`notice` evaluates the following environment variables:

 * `NOTICE_DATE` - text to use for timestamp of `notice`. (default: get output
    of `date`) note that this is static text when provided, so repeated calls
    to `notice` will use the same text given in `NOTICE_DATE`.
 * `NOTICE_DATE_FORMAT` - format to use for `date` output. see `man date`
    (default: default of `date`). not used if `NOTICE_DATE` is set.
 * `NOTICE_SEP` - separator between date and content (default: ` -- `).
 * `NOTICE_LOG` - path of `notice` log file (default: `$HOME/.notice`).
 * `HOME` - if `NOTICE_LOG` is not given, `notice` will evaluate the location
    given by `$HOME`.

See the section titled "example" for examples on how to use these configuration
variables.

format
------

The basic format of the `notice` log is:

    ${NOTICE_DATE}${NOTICE_SEP}${args_or_stdin}

With `notice` defaults, a call of `notice Hello, world!` will look like:

    Sat Aug 15 19:15:39 EDT 2009 -- Hello, world!

where the date would match the output of `date` on the local system.
(See defaults in section titled "configuration.")
